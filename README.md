# react-error-modal

This is a small personal project to display an example of how validation errors can be managed in an informative way using React components. All styling was handled with CSS modules and the components were made to be as modular as possible.

## To View

1. Fork/clone
2. `npm install` in the directory you cloned it to.
3. `npm start` to start up a local server and view the project.

- If your browser doesn't automatically open upon doing `npm start` then you can navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) manually.
